1. **Create the Persistent Volume (PV)**: In the PV definition, you should label the PV with the desired label (`type=logs`) so that the PVC can select it based on this label:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolume
   metadata:
     name: log-pv
     labels:
       type: logs
   spec:
     capacity:
       storage: 1Gi
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     # ... other PV specifications ...
   ```

2. **Create the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: In the PVC definition, you specify label selectors in the `selector` field to indicate that it should bind to PVs with the label `type=logs`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: log-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         type: logs
   ```

With these corrected configurations, the PVC will bind to the PV with the `type=logs` label, provided that a PV with that label exists in the cluster and meets the PVC's capacity and access mode requirements. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate your patience.
