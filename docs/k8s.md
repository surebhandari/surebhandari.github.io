**How to Attach Storage to containers in POD**:

**Context**: When somene wants to run a sidecar container alongside a main container and would like to have a shared storage. In that case, we need to go through 
Persistent Volume(PV) and Persistent Volume Claim(PVC) because containers don't have any storage.
Here are the Steps to Follow.

1. **Create the Persistent Volume (PV)**: In the PV definition, you should label the PV with the desired label (`type=logs`) so that the PVC can select it based on this label:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolume
   metadata:
     name: log-pv
     labels:
       type: logs
   spec:
     capacity:
       storage: 1Gi
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     # ... other PV specifications ...
   ```

2. **Create the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: In the PVC definition, you specify label selectors in the `selector` field to indicate that it should bind to PVs with the label `type=logs`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: log-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         type: logs
   ```

With these corrected configurations, the PVC will bind to the PV with the `type=logs` label, provided that a PV with that label exists in the cluster and meets the PVC's capacity and access mode requirements. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate your patience.

**Question**: Now please provide a deployment configuration file with main application and side car and clearly explain how they are using PVC.

Certainly, here's a Kubernetes Deployment configuration file that includes a main application container and a sidecar container using a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for shared storage. This example demonstrates how both containers can use a shared PVC to access and store data:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: log-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: log-pvc # Reference the PVC name
      containers:
        - name: main-app-container
          image: your-main-app-image:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: log-volume
              mountPath: /app-logs # Mount the shared volume
        - name: log-streaming-sidecar
          image: your-log-streaming-image:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: log-volume
              mountPath: /app-logs # Mount the shared volume
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: log-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Request the desired storage capacity
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: logs # Match the label of the PV you want to bind to
```

Explanation:

1. The deployment (`app-deployment`) specifies two containers: `main-app-container` and `log-streaming-sidecar`. Both containers use the same PVC named `log-pvc`.

2. The PVC (`log-pvc`) is defined separately, specifying the desired access mode, requested storage capacity (e.g., 1Gi), and label selectors. The label selector (`type=logs`) matches the label of the PV that you want the PVC to bind to.

3. Inside the pod template, a volume named `log-volume` is defined, and it uses the PVC `log-pvc` as its source.

4. Both `main-app-container` and `log-streaming-sidecar` containers mount the `log-volume` at `/app-logs`, allowing them to read from and write to the shared storage.

In this configuration, both the main application container and the sidecar container share the same Persistent Volume (`log-pvc`), enabling them to access and store data in the `/app-logs` directory within the pod. This demonstrates a common use case for sharing data between containers in a Kubernetes pod using a PVC.
