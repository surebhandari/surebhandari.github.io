**What is the use of '->' and '=>' in Rust programming language ?**

In the Rust programming language, both `->` and `=>` are used, but they serve different purposes and contexts:

1. **`->` (Arrow Operator):**
   - The `->` arrow operator in Rust is used in function and closure signatures to indicate the return type of the function or closure.
   - It is placed between the parameter list and the return type of a function or closure.
   - Example:

   ```rust
   fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a + b
   }
   ```
   
   In this example, `-> i32` indicates that the function `add` returns a value of type `i32`.

2. **`=>` (Pattern Separator in Match Expressions):**
   - The `=>` symbol is used in Rust's match expressions to separate patterns from their associated code.
   - In a `match` block, you provide different patterns and the corresponding code to execute when a pattern matches.
   - Example:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let number = 42;
       
       match number {
           0 => println!("It's zero"),
           1..=10 => println!("It's between 1 and 10"),
           _ => println!("It's something else"),
       }
   }
   ```
   
   In this example, `0 => println!("It's zero")` uses the `=>` symbol to associate the pattern `0` with the code to print "It's zero".

In summary, `->` is used to indicate the return type of a function or closure, while `=>` is used in match expressions to associate patterns with the code to execute when a pattern matches.

***In Rust, I am reading some tutorial and it says:
The first parameter of any method must be a reference to the instance associated with the method call
Please explain it with a detailed example.***

In Rust, methods are functions that are associated with a particular type, and they can be called on instances of that type. The statement "The first parameter of any method must be a reference to the instance associated with the method call" refers to the fact that the first parameter of a method is always a reference to the instance on which the method is being called. This allows the method to access and modify the instance's data.

Let's break this down with a detailed example:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // A method to calculate the area of a rectangle
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    // Another method to double the dimensions of a rectangle
    fn double_dimensions(&mut self) {
        self.width *= 2;
        self.height *= 2;
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create an instance of Rectangle
    let mut rect = Rectangle {
        width: 5,
        height: 10,
    };

    // Call the `area` method on the Rectangle instance
    let area = rect.area();
    println!("Area: {}", area);

    // Call the `double_dimensions` method on the Rectangle instance
    rect.double_dimensions();
    println!("Updated Width: {}", rect.width);
    println!("Updated Height: {}", rect.height);
}
```

In this example, we have a `Rectangle` struct with two fields: `width` and `height`. We've defined two methods for the `Rectangle` type:

1. The `area` method calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
   - The method takes a reference to `self` as its first parameter using the `&self` syntax. This allows the method to access the instance's fields (`width` and `height`) without taking ownership of the instance.
   - The method doesn't need to modify the instance, so we use a reference.

2. The `double_dimensions` method doubles the width and height of the rectangle.
   - The method takes a mutable reference to `self` as its first parameter using the `&mut self` syntax. This allows the method to modify the instance's fields.
   - The method modifies the instance, so we use a mutable reference.

In both cases, the first parameter of the method is a reference to the instance on which the method is being called. This ensures that the method can access the instance's data and optionally modify it. The use of references ensures that ownership and borrowing rules are followed, making Rust code safe and free from common memory-related errors.
